# üìò SQL Guidebook Project ‚Äî Research Paper Database

## üß© Overview  
This project demonstrates **SQL fundamentals and advanced data manipulation** using a research publication dataset.  
The database models relationships between institutions, authors, research papers, and reviews.

The SQL work explores:
- Database creation, population, and updates.  
- Core query operations (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING).  
- Aggregations and JOINs.  
- Data cleaning and transformation (CASE WHEN, COALESCE). 
- Analytical SQL using window functions and CTEs. 
- Independently explored features (Date functions, Window LAG/LEAD, LIMIT, UNION).

## üóÇ Dataset Creation

For this project, a **sample dataset** was manually created to simulate a research publication environment. Four related tables were designed following **database design best practices**:

1. **Institutions**
   
   - Each institution has a unique `inst_id` (auto-incremented primary key), a name, and a country.  
   - Explicit `inst_id` values were inserted to ensure that foreign key references from authors are never NULL.
  
```sql
           CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS institutions (
             inst_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, -- cannot be NULL
             name      VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
             country   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
         );

            INSERT INTO institutions (inst_id, name, country) VALUES
            (1, 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'USA'),
            (2, 'Stanford University', 'USA'),
            (3, 'Harvard University', 'USA'),
            (4, 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay', 'India'),
            (5, 'Indian Institute of Science', 'India'),
            (6, 'University of Oxford', 'United Kingdom'),
            (7, 'University of Cambridge', 'United Kingdom'),
            (8, 'ETH Zurich', 'Switzerland'),
            (9, 'National University of Singapore', 'Singapore'),
            (10, 'Tsinghua University', 'China');
```

2. **Authors**
   
   - Authors are linked to institutions via `inst_id` (foreign key).  
   - Each author has a unique `author_id`, full name, and field of research.  
   - Sample authors cover various research domains such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Robotics, and AI Ethics.
  
```sql
         CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS authors (
          author_id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
          full_name         VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
          field_of_research VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
          inst_id           INTEGER NOT NULL,
          FOREIGN KEY (inst_id) REFERENCES institutions(inst_id)
         );
         
         -- inserts referencing explicit inst_id
         INSERT INTO authors (full_name, field_of_research, inst_id) VALUES
         ('Alice Kim', 'Machine Learning', 1),
         ('Rohan Mehta', 'Computer Vision', 4),
         ('Lina Zhao', 'Natural Language Processing', 6),
         ('Ethan Ross', 'Robotics', 2),
         ('Sofia Martinez', 'AI Ethics', 3),
         ('Chen Wei', 'Computer Vision', 10);
```

3. **Papers**
   
   - Papers are associated with authors using `author_id` as a foreign key.  
   - Each paper has a unique `paper_id`, title, submission date, and status (`Under Review`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`).  
   - This table models research output for each author.

```sql
         CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS papers (
             paper_id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
             title           VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
             submission_date DATE NOT NULL,
             paper_status    VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (paper_status IN ('Under Review','Accepted','Rejected')),
             author_id       INTEGER NOT NULL,
             FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id)
         );
         
         INSERT INTO papers (title, submission_date, paper_status, author_id) VALUES
         ('Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks', '2024-01-15', 'Accepted', 1),
         ('Self-Supervised Learning for Images', '2024-02-01', 'Under Review', 2),
         ('AI Ethics in Language Models', '2024-02-10', 'Rejected', 3),
         ('Autonomous Drone Navigation', '2024-03-01', 'Accepted', 4),
         ('Prompt Engineering for LLMs', '2024-03-12', 'Under Review', 3),
         ('Ethical AI for Social Media', '2024-03-20', 'Under Review', 5),
         ('Vision Transformers in Action', '2024-03-25', 'Accepted', 6);
```

4. **Reviews**
   
   - Reviews are linked to papers via `paper_id`.  
   - Each review contains a reviewer's name, a score (1‚Äì10), and optional comments.  
   - Multiple reviews per paper were included to support aggregation and ranking queries.

```sql
         CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (
             review_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
             paper_id      INTEGER NOT NULL,
             reviewer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
             score         INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (score BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
             comments      TEXT,
             FOREIGN KEY (paper_id) REFERENCES papers(paper_id)
         );
         
         INSERT INTO reviews (paper_id, reviewer_name, score, comments) VALUES
         (1, 'Dr. Smith', 9, 'Innovative work with strong theoretical foundations.'),
         (1, 'Dr. Brown', 8, 'Solid contribution and clear presentation.'),
         (2, 'Dr. Clark', 7, 'Interesting results, needs more ablation studies.'),
         (3, 'Dr. Kim', 5, 'Important ethical perspective, but lacks depth.'),
         (4, 'Dr. Lee', 10, 'Outstanding work, highly recommended for acceptance.'),
         (4, 'Dr. Adams', 9, 'Strong experimental design and clarity.'),
         (5, 'Dr. White', 8, 'Promising idea, worth exploring further.'),
         (6, 'Dr. Johnson', 7, 'Important societal angle, minor revisions needed.'),
         (7, 'Dr. Green', 9, 'Excellent experimental setup, clear results.');
```

NOTE:
**Why use primary and foreign keys?**
- Primary and foreign key constraints ensure **referential integrity**.

**Why use 'NOT NULL'?**
- `NOT NULL` constraints prevent missing critical information.

**Why use 'CHECK'?**
- CHECK constraints enforce valid values for paper status and review scores.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Operations

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Q1. How to update institution names and confirm changes?

**1. Update Command**
=======
**Update Command**
>>>>>>> 09288495020aebf31e6c9ba61646af95e0a12352

Explanation:

We used the UPDATE command to modify existing data ‚Äî in this case, renaming all countries labeled ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù to ‚ÄúUnited States.‚Äù After the update, we verify the change with a SELECT query.

```sql
UPDATE institutions
SET country = 'United States'
WHERE country = 'USA';

SELECT * 
FROM institutions
WHERE country = 'United States';
```

### Q. Which are the top 5 highest-rated papers? 

**LIMIT Command**

Explanation:
We join the papers and reviews tables, calculate each paper‚Äôs average score using AVG(), and sort results in descending order. The LIMIT 5 ensures only the top 5 are shown.

```sql
SELECT p.title, AVG(r.score) AS avg_score
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Q. How to combine Accepted and Rejected papers into a single list? 

**UNION Command**

Explanation:
The UNION operator merges the results of two queries while removing duplicates. This helps view all papers that are either Accepted or Rejected.

```sql
SELECT title, paper_status FROM papers WHERE paper_status = 'Accepted'
UNION
SELECT title, paper_status FROM papers WHERE paper_status = 'Rejected';
```

Explanation:
We use LEFT JOIN to include institutions even if they have no papers, and count paper IDs grouped by each institution.

```sql
SELECT i.name AS institution,
       COUNT(p.paper_id) AS total_papers
FROM institutions i
LEFT JOIN authors a ON i.inst_id = a.inst_id

**HAVING, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
This query groups papers by authors and counts their contributions. The HAVING clause filters out authors with zero papers.

```sql
SELECT a.full_name AS author,
       COUNT(p.paper_id) AS num_papers
FROM authors a
LEFT JOIN papers p ON a.author_id = p.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id

>>>>>>> 09288495020aebf31e6c9ba61646af95e0a12352

**AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
Using the AVG() aggregate function and grouping by paper, we can find each paper‚Äôs mean score and total review count.

```sql
SELECT p.title, AVG(r.score) AS avg_score, COUNT(r.review_id) AS num_reviews
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```

### Q. Which papers are currently under review?  

**WHERE, ORDER BY Command**

Explanation:
This query filters the papers table for those marked ‚ÄúUnder Review‚Äù and joins with author and institution details.

```sql
SELECT p.title, a.full_name AS author,p.paper_status, i.name AS institution
FROM papers p
JOIN authors a ON p.author_id = a.author_id
JOIN institutions i ON a.inst_id = i.inst_id
WHERE p.paper_status = 'Under Review'
ORDER BY p.submission_date;
```

>>>>>>> 09288495020aebf31e6c9ba61646af95e0a12352

**CASE WHEN, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
Using CASE WHEN, we classify papers into performance categories based on their average review scores.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.title,
    AVG(r.score) AS avg_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(r.score) >= 9 THEN 'Outstanding'
        WHEN AVG(r.score) BETWEEN 7 AND 8.99 THEN 'Strong'
        WHEN AVG(r.score) BETWEEN 5 AND 6.99 THEN 'Moderate'
        ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
    END AS review_category
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```

**RANK() OVER, Window Functions**
 
>>>>>>> 09288495020aebf31e6c9ba61646af95e0a12352
```sql
SELECT 
    p.title,
    AVG(r.score) AS avg_score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(r.score) DESC) AS ranking
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id;
```

### Q. How can authors be sequentially ordered? 

**ROW_NUMBER(), Window Functions**

Explanation:
The ROW_NUMBER() function is used to generate a sequential number for each row ordered by author name.

```sql
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY full_name) AS row_num,
    full_name,
    field_of_research,
    inst_id
FROM authors;
```

### Q. Which institutions have the highest average paper ratings?  

**CTE (WITH), Aggregates, HAVING**

Explanation:
We use a CTE (WITH) to calculate each paper‚Äôs average score first, then aggregate those averages per institution.

```sql
WITH paper_scores AS (
    SELECT 
        p.paper_id,
        a.inst_id,
        AVG(r.score) AS avg_score
    FROM papers p
    JOIN authors a ON p.author_id = a.author_id
    LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
    GROUP BY p.paper_id
)
SELECT 
    i.name AS institution,
    ROUND(AVG(ps.avg_score), 2) AS institution_avg_score
FROM paper_scores ps
JOIN institutions i ON ps.inst_id = i.inst_id
GROUP BY i.inst_id
HAVING institution_avg_score > 8
ORDER BY institution_avg_score DESC;
```
