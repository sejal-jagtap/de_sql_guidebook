## üóÇ Dataset Creation

For this project, a **sample dataset** was manually created to simulate a research publication environment. Four related tables were designed following **database design best practices**:

1. **Institutions**
   
   - Each institution has a unique `inst_id` (auto-incremented primary key), a name, and a country.  
   - Explicit `inst_id` values were inserted to ensure that foreign key references from authors are never NULL.
  
```sql
           CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS institutions (
             inst_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, -- cannot be NULL
             name      VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
             country   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
         );

            INSERT INTO institutions (inst_id, name, country) VALUES
            (1, 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'USA'),
            (2, 'Stanford University', 'USA'),
            (3, 'Harvard University', 'USA'),
            (4, 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay', 'India'),
            (5, 'Indian Institute of Science', 'India'),
            (6, 'University of Oxford', 'United Kingdom'),
            (7, 'University of Cambridge', 'United Kingdom'),
            (8, 'ETH Zurich', 'Switzerland'),
            (9, 'National University of Singapore', 'Singapore'),
            (10, 'Tsinghua University', 'China');
```

2. **Authors**
   
   - Authors are linked to institutions via `inst_id` (foreign key).  
   - Each author has a unique `author_id`, full name, and field of research.  
   - Sample authors cover various research domains such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Robotics, and AI Ethics.
  
```sql
         CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS authors (
          author_id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
          full_name         VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
          field_of_research VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
          inst_id           INTEGER NOT NULL,
          FOREIGN KEY (inst_id) REFERENCES institutions(inst_id)
         );
         
         -- inserts referencing explicit inst_id
         INSERT INTO authors (full_name, field_of_research, inst_id) VALUES
         ('Alice Kim', 'Machine Learning', 1),
         ('Rohan Mehta', 'Computer Vision', 4),
         ('Lina Zhao', 'Natural Language Processing', 6),
         ('Ethan Ross', 'Robotics', 2),
         ('Sofia Martinez', 'AI Ethics', 3),
         ('Chen Wei', 'Computer Vision', 10);
```

3. **Papers**
   
   - Papers are associated with authors using `author_id` as a foreign key.  
   - Each paper has a unique `paper_id`, title, submission date, and status (`Under Review`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`).  
   - This table models research output for each author.

```sql
         CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS papers (
             paper_id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
             title           VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
             submission_date DATE NOT NULL,
             paper_status    VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (paper_status IN ('Under Review','Accepted','Rejected')),
             author_id       INTEGER NOT NULL,
             FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id)
         );
         
         INSERT INTO papers (title, submission_date, paper_status, author_id) VALUES
         ('Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks', '2024-01-15', 'Accepted', 1),
         ('Self-Supervised Learning for Images', '2024-02-01', 'Under Review', 2),
         ('AI Ethics in Language Models', '2024-02-10', 'Rejected', 3),
         ('Autonomous Drone Navigation', '2024-03-01', 'Accepted', 4),
         ('Prompt Engineering for LLMs', '2024-03-12', 'Under Review', 3),
         ('Ethical AI for Social Media', '2024-03-20', 'Under Review', 5),
         ('Vision Transformers in Action', '2024-03-25', 'Accepted', 6);
```

4. **Reviews**
   
   - Reviews are linked to papers via `paper_id`.  
   - Each review contains a reviewer's name, a score (1‚Äì10), and optional comments.  
   - Multiple reviews per paper were included to support aggregation and ranking queries.

```sql
         CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (
             review_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
             paper_id      INTEGER NOT NULL,
             reviewer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
             score         INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (score BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
             comments      TEXT,
             FOREIGN KEY (paper_id) REFERENCES papers(paper_id)
         );
         
         INSERT INTO reviews (paper_id, reviewer_name, score, comments) VALUES
         (1, 'Dr. Smith', 9, 'Innovative work with strong theoretical foundations.'),
         (1, 'Dr. Brown', 8, 'Solid contribution and clear presentation.'),
         (2, 'Dr. Clark', 7, 'Interesting results, needs more ablation studies.'),
         (3, 'Dr. Kim', 5, 'Important ethical perspective, but lacks depth.'),
         (4, 'Dr. Lee', 10, 'Outstanding work, highly recommended for acceptance.'),
         (4, 'Dr. Adams', 9, 'Strong experimental design and clarity.'),
         (5, 'Dr. White', 8, 'Promising idea, worth exploring further.'),
         (6, 'Dr. Johnson', 7, 'Important societal angle, minor revisions needed.'),
         (7, 'Dr. Green', 9, 'Excellent experimental setup, clear results.');
```

### Key Considerations:

**Why use primary and foreign keys?**
- Primary and foreign key constraints ensure **referential integrity**.

**Why use 'NOT NULL'?**
- `NOT NULL` constraints prevent missing critical information.

**Why use 'CHECK'?**
- CHECK constraints enforce valid values for paper status and review scores.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Operations

### Q1. How to update institution names and confirm changes?

**Update Command**

Explanation:
We used the UPDATE command to modify existing data ‚Äî in this case, renaming all countries labeled ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù to ‚ÄúUnited States.‚Äù After the update, we verify the change with a SELECT query.

```sql
UPDATE institutions
SET country = 'United States'
WHERE country = 'USA';

SELECT * 
FROM institutions
WHERE country = 'United States';
```

<img width="329" height="71" alt="update_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b7352b-80b6-4b48-b88f-0371c8c6b620" />

### Q2. Which are the top 5 highest-rated papers? 

**LIMIT Command**

Explanation:
We join the papers and reviews tables, calculate each paper‚Äôs average score using AVG(), and sort results in descending order. The LIMIT 5 ensures only the top 5 are shown.

```sql
SELECT p.title, AVG(r.score) AS avg_score
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

<img width="247" height="104" alt="top 5 papers based on avg score" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad60de6-12da-43fc-ab08-d3947d9e2369" />


### Q3. How to combine Accepted and Rejected papers into a single list? 

**UNION Command**

Explanation:
The UNION operator merges the results of two queries while removing duplicates. This helps view all papers that are either Accepted or Rejected.

```sql
SELECT title, paper_status FROM papers WHERE paper_status = 'Accepted'
UNION
SELECT title, paper_status FROM papers WHERE paper_status = 'Rejected';
```

<img width="256" height="89" alt="papers accepted and rejected" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aaf8ee3-bc3e-4e18-972f-8387142a1040" />

### Q4. How to display each author‚Äôs institution and research field?

**JOIN and ORDER BY Command**

Explanation:
Using an INNER JOIN, we link authors with institutions via inst_id to show full author profiles alongside their institutions.

```sql
SELECT a.author_id, a.full_name, a.field_of_research, i.name AS institution
FROM authors a
JOIN institutions i ON a.inst_id = i.inst_id
ORDER BY a.full_name;
```

<img width="468" height="117" alt="q4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a4c301-cb52-4b20-97da-5d0938918e11" />

### Q5. How to list all papers with author names and their institutions? 

**Multi-table JOIN Command**

Explanation:
We join three tables ‚Äî papers, authors, and institutions ‚Äî to display complete details for each paper, including author and institution information.

```sql 
SELECT p.paper_id, p.title, p.paper_status, p.submission_date,
       a.full_name AS author, i.name AS institution
FROM papers p
JOIN authors a ON p.author_id = a.author_id
JOIN institutions i ON a.inst_id = i.inst_id
ORDER BY p.submission_date;
```

<img width="608" height="135" alt="List all papers with author name and institution" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db1ed402-e053-4944-b1c3-ce037ca17a16" />

### Q6. How to count total papers published per institution?

**LEFT JOIN, COUNT, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
We use LEFT JOIN to include institutions even if they have no papers, and count paper IDs grouped by each institution.

```sql
SELECT i.name AS institution,
       COUNT(p.paper_id) AS total_papers
FROM institutions i
LEFT JOIN authors a ON i.inst_id = a.inst_id
LEFT JOIN papers p ON a.author_id = p.author_id
GROUP BY i.inst_id
ORDER BY total_papers DESC;
```

<img width="265" height="179" alt="total_papers" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05409a5e-3086-482f-848a-fc3d2b5df0b0" />

### Q7. How to count how many papers each author has written?

**HAVING, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
This query groups papers by authors and counts their contributions. The HAVING clause filters out authors with zero papers.

```sql
SELECT a.full_name AS author,
       COUNT(p.paper_id) AS num_papers
FROM authors a
LEFT JOIN papers p ON a.author_id = p.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id
HAVING COUNT(p.paper_id) > 0
ORDER BY num_papers DESC;
```

<img width="182" height="119" alt="papers per author" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40521583-9985-4dde-a886-bda17f99ddc7" />

### Q8. How to calculate average review score per paper? 

**AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
Using the AVG() aggregate function and grouping by paper, we can find each paper‚Äôs mean score and total review count.

```sql
SELECT p.title, AVG(r.score) AS avg_score, COUNT(r.review_id) AS num_reviews
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```
<img width="349" height="136" alt="review score per paper" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06946a9-c05f-4631-9ffb-97ea6eb947dc" />


### Q9. Which papers are currently under review?  

**WHERE, ORDER BY Command**

Explanation:
This query filters the papers table for those marked ‚ÄúUnder Review‚Äù and joins with author and institution details.

```sql
SELECT p.title, a.full_name AS author,p.paper_status, i.name AS institution
FROM papers p
JOIN authors a ON p.author_id = a.author_id
JOIN institutions i ON a.inst_id = i.inst_id
WHERE p.paper_status = 'Under Review'
ORDER BY p.submission_date;
```

<img width="502" height="68" alt="papers under review" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dec5650-3ac4-4422-9def-7ea471cdf3a1" />

### Q10. How to categorize papers by average score?

**CASE WHEN, GROUP BY Command**

Explanation:
Using CASE WHEN, we classify papers into performance categories based on their average review scores.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.title,
    AVG(r.score) AS avg_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(r.score) >= 9 THEN 'Outstanding'
        WHEN AVG(r.score) BETWEEN 7 AND 8.99 THEN 'Strong'
        WHEN AVG(r.score) BETWEEN 5 AND 6.99 THEN 'Moderate'
        ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
    END AS review_category
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```

<img width="361" height="137" alt="categ paers by average review score" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bbdf8f3-c025-48c2-82b6-6e567c86e4ac" />

### Q11. How to rank papers by their average scores?

**RANK() OVER, Window Functions**

Explanation:
Window functions like RANK() let us assign ranks dynamically based on average review scores.
 
```sql
SELECT 
    p.title,
    AVG(r.score) AS avg_score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(r.score) DESC) AS ranking
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id;
```

<img width="331" height="136" alt="rank papers by avg review score" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/987b72e7-aef9-4b90-8a4a-7642ebb8dc60" />

### Q12. How can authors be sequentially ordered? 

**ROW_NUMBER(), Window Functions**

Explanation:
The ROW_NUMBER() function is used to generate a sequential number for each row ordered by author name.

```sql
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY full_name) AS row_num,
    full_name,
    field_of_research,
    inst_id
FROM authors;
```

<img width="392" height="121" alt="assign row numbers to authors" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261e8946-4b3d-49df-86b2-9420eeac1bb6" />

### Q13. Which institutions have the highest average paper ratings?  

**CTE (WITH), Aggregates, HAVING**

Explanation:
We use a CTE (WITH) to calculate each paper‚Äôs average score first, then aggregate those averages per institution.

```sql
WITH paper_scores AS (
    SELECT 
        p.paper_id,
        a.inst_id,
        AVG(r.score) AS avg_score
    FROM papers p
    JOIN authors a ON p.author_id = a.author_id
    LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
    GROUP BY p.paper_id
)
SELECT 
    i.name AS institution,
    ROUND(AVG(ps.avg_score), 2) AS institution_avg_score
FROM paper_scores ps
JOIN institutions i ON ps.inst_id = i.inst_id
GROUP BY i.inst_id
HAVING institution_avg_score > 8
ORDER BY institution_avg_score DESC;
```

<img width="296" height="69" alt="papers with score above 8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78dd9b12-2f4a-41cd-aee6-021d134126e1" />

### Q14. How to handle missing scores and replace NULL with 0?

**COALESCE Command**

Explanation:
COALESCE() replaces NULL values with a default value (0 here), ensuring no missing data in average calculations.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.title,
    COALESCE(AVG(r.score), 0) AS avg_score
FROM papers p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.paper_id = r.paper_id
GROUP BY p.paper_id;
```

<img width="245" height="134" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/134ac8f4-95c9-49f6-9ae0-838e8d23afb0" />

### Q15. How to extract month and year from submission dates?

**Date functions (`strftime`)**

Explanation:
SQLite‚Äôs strftime() function allows date formatting ‚Äî here used to extract submission month and year from date fields.

```sql
SELECT 
    title,
    submission_date,
    strftime('%m', submission_date) AS submission_month,
    strftime('%Y', submission_date) AS submission_year
FROM papers
ORDER BY submission_date;
```
